## plan
**1. Downloading data**

For the hotels and Airbnb figures
- London borough MSOAs (shp)
- Airbnbs (csv)
- Hotels (shp)
For the study area map
- Outline of the UK (shp)
- UK cities (shp)

**2. Setting the CRS and filtering**

- CRS for the boroughs: British National Grid (BNG)
- Filter hotels from the OSM data
- Filter equivalent Airbnbs  
  (e.g., room_type == "Entire home/apt" & availability_365 == 365)

**3. Joining and summing data**

- Join Airbnbs to MSOAs and count per MSOA
- Join Hotels to MSOAs and count per MSOA

**4. Making some maps**

- Map of Airbnbs
- Map of Hotels
- Combined comparison map
